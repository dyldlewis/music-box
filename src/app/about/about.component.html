<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Empire Records is a local, privately-owned music retail store -- but it's also so much more. Providing solace and refuge for misfit teens who have been cast aside by the society that raised them, Empire Records is an iconic community locale and a beacon of hope for small business.

Help us save the store from being bought out by the greedy capitalist crooks at Music Town!</p>
